# Explore functional patterns in C#
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course **Explore functional patterns in C#**. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning](LICOURSEURL).

## Description

Functional programming (FP) languages are well equipped to handle modern software problems like massive scale, distributed systems and multiple threaded runtimes. Microsoft created the F# functional language to address this problem space and along the way they also introduced many FP features to C#. In this course we’ll look at how to exploit these new features, such as higher order functions and immutability to add functional programming to your code.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

## Installing
