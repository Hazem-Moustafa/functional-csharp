# Explore functional patterns in C#
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course **Explore functional patterns in C#**. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].


Functional programming offers developers a straightforward way to tackle modern software problems like massive scale, distributed systems, and multiple threaded runtimes. Microsoft created the F# functional language to address this problem space and along the way they also introduced many FP features to C#. 

Curious about how to work functional programming patterns into your .NET applications? In this course, Walt Ritscher shows you how. Discover how to leverage the functional programming features in C# to transform your code. Walt covers key topics such as immutability, higher-order functions, and why expressions are better for functional programs. Plus, learn how to compose function flow in C# using pipelining; work with functional programming concepts like map, filter and bind in LINQ; and more.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

## Installing  
To use these exercise files, follow the instructions in the course to learn how to work with GitHub content.
For this course the instructor uses Visual Studio 2019, any edition is sufficient (Community, Professional, Enterprise).
